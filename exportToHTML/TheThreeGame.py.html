<span class="s0"># Description: TheThreeGame that allows two players to play a game in which they alternately choose numbers from 1-9.</span>
<span class="s0"># They may not choose a number that has already been selected by either player. If at any point exactly three of a</span>
<span class="s0"># player's numbers sum to exactly 15, then that player has won. If all numbers from 1-9 are chosen, but neither player</span>
<span class="s0"># has won, then the game ends in a draw. Player &quot;first_player&quot; has the first turn.</span>
